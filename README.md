**Instructions**
1. Double Operand Operations: Enter the first operand, then the operation, followed by the second operand, and press the equal button. For example: 1 + 2 =.
2. Single Operand Operations: Enter the operand followed by the operation button. For example: entering 0 sin computes sin(0).
3. Percentage Calculation: Enter the operand for which the percentage will be calculated, then the multiplication button (x), followed by the percentage amount, and finally press the percent button (%). For example: 200 x 5%.


**Calculator Functions**
1. _C_: Clear
2. _Del_: Delete the last digit
3. _Mod_: Remainder of division
4. _Abs_: Absolute value


**Technical Description**
1. This project is implemented in a single Java class file.
2. The entire functionality of the calculator is encapsulated within this file.
3. The user interface is designed using the Java Swing API.


**Limitations**
1. The calculator cannot evaluate complex mathematical expressions.
2. It has limitations due to the size of value containers (e.g., variables), preventing it from handling very large numbers (beyond 32 or 64 bits).
3. The calculator can handle a maximum of 15 digits.
